lib/vcstream/README

 lib/vcstream directory exists for creating iostream library linkage file
src/vcstrm.cxx and src/vcstrm.h for Vitual C++. These files contain 
interface methods for iostream library. You can create those by doing 'make'
under this directory. Usually nobody but only author should do this. User 
doesn't need to recognize this.

 Reason of having special vcstrm.cxx for VC++ is difference in class
inheritance structure.

 Creating src/vcstrm.cxx

 1) Edit src/newlink.c
  Start a text editor, look for '#define G__N_EXPLICITDESTRUCTOR'. Please
  comment this line out. 

 2) Create special 'cint'
  Go back to $CINTSYSDIR and do make to create special 'cint'. You may need
  to specify src/fakestrm.cxx in src/Makefile.

 3) Come to src/vcstream directory and do make to create src/vcstrm.cxx.

 4) Edit src/newlink.c
  Edit src/newlink.c and restore '#define G__N_EXPLICITDESTRUCTOR' macro.

 5) Go back to $CINTSYSDIR and do make to create updated cint.
